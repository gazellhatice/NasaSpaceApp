# 🌎 TEMPO Air Quality Monitoring Web App

A modern, interactive web application inspired by **NASA’s TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution)** mission — built to visualize real-time air quality, explain pollutant parameters, and raise public awareness about atmospheric health.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**TEMPO Air Quality App** brings NASA’s atmospheric mission to the web.  
It combines real scientific context, AQI visualization, and educational components to help users better understand how air quality affects human health and the planet.

From orbit to your browser — this app turns TEMPO’s story and data into an accessible, immersive experience.

## ✨ Features

- 🛰️ **Mission Insights** – Learn how NASA’s TEMPO monitors air pollution from space.  
- 📈 **AQI Visualization** – View pollutant types and their safe ranges (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, O₃, SO₂, CO).  
- 🌈 **Color-Coded AQI Scale** – Instantly see whether the air quality is good or hazardous.  
- 📅 **Mission Timeline** – Explore TEMPO’s journey from launch to ongoing operations.  
- 🤝 **Collaboration Section** – Highlights NASA, NOAA, and EPA partnership.  
- 💡 **Educational Purpose** – Connects air quality to UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3 & 13).

## 🧠 Mission Background

TEMPO is NASA’s first space-based instrument designed to measure air pollution across **North America hourly** from a geostationary orbit.  
By observing pollutants such as **O₃**, **NO₂**, **SO₂**, and **aerosols**, it provides critical data for:
- Air quality forecasting  
- Climate and environmental studies  
- Public health decision-making

## 🧩 Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React + Vite / Create-React-App  
- HTML 5 / CSS 3 / JavaScript (ES6)  
- Responsive design with custom components  

**Backend (optional for data APIs)**
- Python Flask or Node.js Express  
- RESTful endpoints for real-time AQI data  

**Styling**
- Custom CSS (`About.css`, `Home.css`)  
- Gradient and glassmorphism design  
- NASA-inspired dark-sky color palette
